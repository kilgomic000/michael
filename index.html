    <section id="abc001"><p> The outfits of the game don't seem like they have changed much however there is one slight detail 
      not so easily seen but definatly there. The only part of the outfits that has changed is the addition of shingaurds with
      fifa making shingaurds a required piece of equipment in the 1990s, you can see a picture <a href = "https://goalwa.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/sb13.jpg?w=640"> here</a> 
      of Steve Buttle playing in a profesional soccer match in 1977 without
      shingaurds.</p></section>
